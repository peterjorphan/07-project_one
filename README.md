# Project Description / Outline
We intend to analyze data from taxi trips in Chicago and weather data via APIs to look for any relationships present.

# Research Questions To Be Answered
- Are cabs more popular during bad weather? Is it less popular during good weather?
    - What constitutes good / poor weather? Temperature / precipitation / wind / divergence from the norm?
- Do trip lengths get affected by weather?
- Does weather decrease or increase the average length of trips taken?
