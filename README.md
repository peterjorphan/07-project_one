# Project Description / Outline
We intend to analyze Uber data and fuel price data via APIs to look for any relationship between the price, popularity, surge status, etc. and fuel price. 

# Research Questions To Be Answered
- Is Uber more popular during poor weather? Is it less popular during good weather?
    What constitutes good / poor weather? Temperature / precipitation / wind / divergence from the NotImplementedError
- Is surge pricing affected by weather?
- Is surge pricing / status affected by fuel price?
- Is uber more popular / less popular when fuel price is high or low?
- Is uber pool more / less popular during high / low fuel prices?
- Do trip lengths get affected by weather?
- Does weather decrease or increase the average length of trips taken?

# Data Sets To Be Used
Uber API, Dark Sky API (weather), fuel price API (TBD after comparing features of free APIs available)

# Rough Breakdown Of Tasks
- Create better title
- Find best fuel price API
- Retrieve necessary API keys
- Look through documentation to see which calls are available to make based on the scope of our research questions
- Create any necessary index keys to join the datasets from the separate APIs
- Clean / organize data in accordance with scope of project
- Input cleaned data into dataframes
- Create master dictionary of dataframes containing cleaned data
- Decide what are the best, most interesting relationships that can be analyzed through the gathered data
- Create visualizations based on those interesting relationships
- Draw conclusions from the visualizations
- Test conclusions
- Create writeup of conclusions, analysis, further questions, future considerations, and current limitations
- Create presentation
- Practice giving the presentation
- Party
